# RetroBeat

A music player app with the vibe of good old vinyl players.

In 2016, I published an [article](https://medium.com/@andremion/music-player-3a85864d6df7) about how to code a design proposal.

I noticed that a lot of people had difficulty building motion designs.

**RetroBeat** is an updated version of that proposal that uses modern tools and frameworks and now also targets iOS. ðŸš€

## Music source

Currently fetching playlists from [Deezer API](https://developers.deezer.com/api/explorer) where those songs are previews of 30 seconds.

The solution is flexible enough to support another source.
